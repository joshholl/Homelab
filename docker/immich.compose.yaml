# Recommended: download the official docker-compose.yml and .env into this directory:
#   wget -O docker-compose.upstream.yml \
#     https://github.com/immich-app/immich/releases/latest/download/docker-compose.yml
#   wget -O .env \
#     https://github.com/immich-app/immich/releases/latest/download/example.env
#
# Then edit .env so that:
#   UPLOAD_LOCATION=/mnt/aegir/media/immich-library
#   DB_DATA_LOCATION=/mnt/verkamaedhr/docker/immich-db
#
# To deploy:
#   docker compose -f docker-compose.upstream.yml up -d
